As a designer turned developer, I have a unique understanding of how the two sides of the team work. Familiar with the development process and the design process, I can act as a bridge between the two groups and help clarify the confusion. It is also easier for me to take designs and convert them to front-end codes with attention to detail. While I have experience working in React and Angular, as well as libraries like D3 and jQuery, I prefer to use Vanilla JavaScript and the capabilities of CSS to build my front-end experiences. Depending on the project, I may choose to use Object-Oriented, MV* patterns, functional programming, or procedural.

I have certification in front-end and full-stack web development through Udacity and find most of my projects to be based around Python (Flask for the web) with JavaScript and SCSS on the front.  Along with Python, I am familiar with PHP, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

My work history has included developing everything from web landing page experiences to web applications solely based on custom coded JavaScript, corporate website development, mobile apps, and full-stack web applications.
