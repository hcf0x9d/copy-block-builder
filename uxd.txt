My past in User Experience centers around web applications and SaaS environments, helping to provide the user with an intuitive experience engaging in challenging tasks involving data analysis and file in-browser file editing.

Starting from requirements gathering and Information Architecture, I have been able to work closely with stakeholders and clients to push further into user-flow mapping and low-fidelity wireframes. User testing is a pillar to excellent user experience and provides me with the information needed to iterate the wireframes with a constant feedback loop. With an in-depth understanding of UX best practices, including annotating designs with ISO standards, I build a case for the designs I generate, focusing less on "clever design" of interface and more on usability.
I have used most of the primary UX tools available including:
- Balsamiq
- InVision
- Sketch
- Figma
- Adobe XD
Although I have used prototyping programs, I find better success with making my prototypes in code to provide a more realistic testing experience.
