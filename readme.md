# Copy Block Builder

This project, while initially developed to build my cover letters for job hunting, can be used to build any sort of canned responses that you would need with variable content.

## Installation & Usage

- Download
- Adjust the content to your needing (in the .txt files)
- Run in terminal with `$ python constructor.py`
- The terminal will ask a series of questions and build the cover letter
- Output prints in the terminal for now

TODO: Output to an easier space for copying/pasting, and consider output to file. 

**Requires Python 3.7+**
