I love to make clean, intuitive designs and have created several brand packages over my career. Logo design, brand guidelines, and brand management have been a big part of my career as a designer. With experience in data visualization, social media posts, illustration, photo editing and manipulation, and video production, I can seamlessly meld into any design team, filling roles that you need without the trouble of outsourcing the work.

As a freelancer, I have worked with PR agencies, large and small companies alike. I have spent time working in rigid design environments for companies like Capital One but have also had absolute freedom over CI Security design. Most recently, at CI Security, I was placed in charge of the visual brand for the company, including logo development, iconography, and creating a visual design language.
