Recently at Medable, I have assisted in creating a design system. Though partially based on TailwindCSS, we worked hard to make the system more bespoke by creating color palettes that were more a11y friendly. During this process, we also had to ensure our components were prepared for i18n requirements, including everything from RTL language support and sensitivity towards different cultures as I designed our icon set and color use guidelines.

During my career, I have also had the opportunity to work heavily in logo design, brand guidelines, and brand management.
