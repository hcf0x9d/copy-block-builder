As a designer turned developer, I have a unique understanding of how the two sides of the team work together. Familiar with the development and design processes, I bridge the two groups and help clarify the confusion. It is also easier for me to take designs and convert them to front-end code with the attention to detail a designer would be looking for. 

I have experience working with Object-Oriented and MV* patterns in vanilla JavaScript, but I am also familiar with React and TypeScript and libraries like D3.js.

Along with my certification in front-end web development, I have also received the full-stack web development certification. My server-side development environments generally revolve around Python, though I am familiar with PHP, Elixir, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
